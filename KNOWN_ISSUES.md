## Issue #1: Touchpad Stops Working After Chipset Update

**Affected Systems**: Lenovo ThinkPad T480 and T480s laptops

**Symptoms**:  
- Touchpad becomes completely unresponsive after chipset INFs update  
- No cursor movement or touchpad clicks registered

**Cause**:  
Chipset INF update interferes with touchpad driver functionality.

**Solution**:
1. Download the appropriate touchpad driver for your model:
   - **ELAN UltraNav Driver** (for ThinkPad T480s):  
     `n22ga09w.exe` – https://download.lenovo.com/pccbbs/mobiles/n22ga09w.exe
   - **Synaptics UltraNav Driver** (for ThinkPad T480):  
     `n23gz21w.exe` – https://download.lenovo.com/pccbbs/mobiles/n23gz21w.exe
2. Run the downloaded installer as Administrator  
3. Restart your system

## Issue #2: PowerShell Execution Policy Restriction

**Affected Systems**: All Windows systems with default PowerShell settings

**Symptoms**:
- SFX EXE fails to run with PowerShell execution policy errors  
- Script terminates immediately without user interaction  
- Error message:  
  ```
  File ... cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system
  ```

**Cause**:  
Windows PowerShell blocks script execution by default for security reasons.

**Solution**:

### For SFX EXE Users

#### ✅ Permanent Fix (Recommended)
1. **Press Windows + X** and select **Windows PowerShell (Admin)**
2. Run the command:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   ```
3. Type **Y** to confirm  
4. Run the ChipsetUpdater-10.1-2025.11-INF-Win10-Win11.exe normally

#### ⚠️ Temporary Fix (One-Time Bypass)
1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator  
2. Navigate to your EXE location  
3. Run:
   ```cmd
   PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "& {Start-Process -FilePath 'ChipsetUpdater-10.1-2025.x.x-Win10-Win11.exe' -Verb RunAs}"
   ```

---

### For PS1 Users (Direct PowerShell Script)

#### Permanent Fix:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```
Type **Y** to confirm.  
Now you can run the PS1 script normally.

#### Temporary Fix:
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "universal-intel-device-updater.ps1"
```

---

### Alternative: Use Batch Files Instead

If the SFX continues to fail:

1. Download both `.bat` and `.ps1` files  
2. Place them in the same folder  
3. Right-click the `.bat` file → **Run as administrator**

---

### Security Notes
- Permanent fix affects only the current user and is safe for trusted scripts  
- Temporary bypass is safest for one-time use  
- Revert execution policy anytime with:  
  ```powershell
  Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Scope CurrentUser
  ```

   ```
   C:\Windows\Temp\IntelChipset
   ```
2. Run the script again  
3. Ensure a stable internet connection during download

## Issue #4: Installer Cannot Continue Due to Missing or Corrupted Previous Intel Chipset Installation

**Symptoms**:  
- The installer reports that it cannot continue  
- Windows Installer (MSI) cannot find the original Intel Chipset Device Software package  
- Installation halts before INF processing begins

**Cause**:  
This issue occurs when a previous installation of *Intel Chipset Device Software* was not cleanly uninstalled or its original MSI package has become corrupted or missing.  
This problem existed *before* using the Universal Intel Chipset Updater.

**Solution**:

1. **Uninstall via Windows (if possible)**  
   Try removing **Intel Chipset Device Software** from the standard Windows *Apps & Features* list.

2. **Reinstall (you need the same version of SetupChipset.exe file).**  
   - Copy the version from the end of the link in the "Use source" window
     e.g. C:\ProgramData\Package Cache\{D220324C-2510-4BF2-B789-56832E9223E2}v10.1.18981.6008
   - Search Google for the missing package: Download Intel Chipset Device Software v10.1.18981.6008
   - Download the SetupChipset.exe file (may be zipped) and reinstall it

3. **Use a Cleanup Tool (Recommended)**  
   If the entry is missing or the uninstall fails, use **[Revo Uninstaller (Free Version)](https://www.revouninstaller.com/products/revo-uninstaller-free/)**.  
   It will remove:
   - leftover registry entries  
   - broken MSI references  
   - residual program files  

   Community reports, including MSI forum discussions, confirm that Revo Uninstaller reliably fixes this issue.

3. **Reinstall the Intel Chipset Package**  
   After cleanup, run the installer again. It should now proceed normally.

**Important**:  
A successful installation will always show one of two prompts:
- **Installation/Upgrade**, or  
- **Downgrade**

If neither appears, cleanup was incomplete.

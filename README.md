## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 🤔 Is this tool safe to use?
Yes! This tool has undergone comprehensive independent security audits by 6 different AI experts with an average score of 9.1/10. Multiple auditors confirmed it's the safest and most stable version ever released, suitable for daily use, corporate deployment, and technician toolkits.

Security measures include:

- Hash verification of all downloads
- Automatic system restore points before installation
- Official Intel drivers only from trusted sources
- Comprehensive pre-installation checks

**Version 10.1-2025.11.6** is strongly recommended by security auditors for optimal safety and performance.

### 🔄 Will this update all my Intel drivers?
This tool specifically updates chipset INF files. It does not update GPU, network, or other device drivers.

### ⚠️ What are the risks?
As with any system modification, there's a small risk of temporary system instability. The automated restore point minimizes this risk significantly.

### 💾 Where are files downloaded?
Files are temporarily stored in `C:\Windows\Temp\IntelChipset\` and automatically cleaned up after installation.

### 🔧 What if something goes wrong?
The tool creates a system restore point before making changes. You can also check detailed logs in the temp directory.

### 🔄 How does the automatic update check work?
The tool compares your current version with the latest version on GitHub. If a newer version is available, it offers to download it directly to your Downloads folder with full verification.

### 🔒 What does self-hash verification do?
Before execution, the tool calculates its own SHA-256 hash and compares it with the official hash from GitHub. This ensures the file hasn't been modified, corrupted, or tampered with.

### 📧 How are updates notified?
The tool automatically checks for updates on each run and clearly notifies you if a newer version is available, with options to continue or update.

### 🏷️ Why is the certificate "not trusted"?
The FirstEver.tech certificate is self-signed for project authenticity. Public trust requires expensive commercial certificates, but the included certificate allows verification of file origin.

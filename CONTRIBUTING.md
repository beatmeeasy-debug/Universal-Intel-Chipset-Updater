## Suggesting Enhancements

### Before Submitting an Enhancement

1. **Check if it's already implemented** in the latest version
2. **Search existing feature requests** in issues
3. **Consider the scope** - Does it align with the project's goals?

### How to Submit a Good Enhancement Request

Use the **Feature Request** issue template and include:

- **Clear Title**: Concise description of the enhancement
- **Problem Statement**: What problem does this solve?
- **Proposed Solution**: How would you implement it?
- **Alternatives Considered**: Other approaches you've thought about
- **Use Cases**: Real-world scenarios where this would be useful
- **Impact**: Who would benefit from this?

**Example Feature Request:**
```markdown
**Title**: Add support for exporting hardware scan results to CSV

**Problem**: Users cannot easily share or analyze their chipset configuration

**Proposed Solution**: 
Add a `-ExportCSV` parameter that saves detected HWIDs and INF versions to a CSV file

**Use Cases**:
- IT administrators managing multiple systems
- Users comparing configurations across devices
- Troubleshooting hardware detection issues

**Benefits**: Improved diagnostics and system documentation
```

## Style Guidelines

### PowerShell Code Style

#### General Principles
- **Clarity over cleverness**: Readable code is maintainable code
- **Consistent formatting**: Follow existing code patterns
- **Meaningful names**: Use descriptive variable and function names
- **Error handling**: Always include proper error checking

#### Naming Conventions
```powershell
# Variables: PascalCase
$DownloadUrl = "https://example.com"
$HashValue = "abc123..."

# Functions: Verb-Noun format, PascalCase
function Get-IntelHardwareId { }
function Test-FileSignature { }

# Constants: ALL_CAPS with underscores
$TEMP_DIR = "C:\Windows\Temp\IntelChipset"
$VENDOR_ID = "8086"
```

#### Code Formatting
```powershell
# Use 4-space indentation (no tabs)
if ($condition) {
    Write-Host "Message"
    # Nested code
    foreach ($item in $collection) {
        Process-Item $item
    }
}

# Line length: Keep under 120 characters when possible
# Break long lines logically
$result = Invoke-WebRequest `
    -Uri $url `
    -Method Get `
    -Headers $headers

# Space around operators
$sum = $a + $b
$isValid = ($value -eq $expected)
```

#### Comments
```powershell
# Single-line comments for brief explanations
$retryCount = 3  # Maximum retry attempts

# Multi-line comments for complex logic
<#
    This function verifies the digital signature of downloaded files
    by checking against Intel Corporation certificates in the system store.
    Returns $true if signature is valid, $false otherwise.
#>
function Test-IntelSignature {
    # Implementation
}

# TODO comments for future improvements
# TODO: Add support for custom download directories
```

#### Error Handling
```powershell
# Always use try-catch for operations that can fail
try {
    $result = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url
    # Process result
}
catch {
    Write-Host "Error: Failed to download file - $_" -ForegroundColor Red
    # Fallback logic or cleanup
}

# Validate inputs
if (-not $filePath) {
    Write-Error "File path is required"
    return
}
```

### Documentation Style

#### README and Markdown Files
- Use clear, concise language
- Break up text with headers and lists
- Include examples for complex concepts
- Keep line length reasonable (80-100 characters in paragraphs)
- Use proper Markdown formatting

#### Code Comments
- Explain **why**, not **what** (code shows what)
- Update comments when code changes
- Use clear, professional language
- Avoid redundant comments

**Good:**
```powershell
# Retry with backup URL if primary source is unavailable
$downloadUrl = $backupUrl
```

**Bad:**
```powershell
# Set download URL to backup URL
$downloadUrl = $backupUrl
```

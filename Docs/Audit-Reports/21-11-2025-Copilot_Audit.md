\# Audit Report: Universal Intel Chipset Updater



---



\## Executive Summary



The \*\*Universal Intel Chipset Updater\*\* project automates the detection and installation of Intel chipset INF drivers across multiple generations of hardware. It leverages Batch and PowerShell scripts to orchestrate downloads, verification, and installation. The project demonstrates strong transparency, security-conscious design, and thorough documentation. However, several areas could be hardened further to ensure maximum reliability and safety for end users.



\*\*Overall Score: 8.6 / 10\*\*

\## Scope of Audit



| Area | Files / Sources | Key Findings |

|------|-----------------|--------------|

| \*\*Executables\*\* | `Universal-Intel-Chipset-Updater.bat`, `Universal-Intel-Chipset-Updater.ps1`, `Get-Intel-HWIDs.bat`, `Get-Intel-HWIDs.ps1` | Strong orchestration, admin enforcement, multi-layer verification; needs stricter error codes and ExecutionPolicy hardening |

| \*\*Security\*\* | `SECURITY.md`, `SECURITY-AUDITS.md`, `docs/audit-reports/` | Good practices declared; disclosure process could be more formalized |

| \*\*Documentation\*\* | INF database, download links, known issues, project background (EN/PL) | Clear and accessible; naming consistency and recovery guidance could be improved |

| \*\*Assets\*\* | Screenshots | Useful for UX, no security impact |

| \*\*Legal\*\* | `LICENSE` (MIT), WiX Ms-RL declaration | Transparent and compliant |

| \*\*Releases\*\* | v10.1.20266.8668, v10.1-2025.11.5 | Latest release adds restore points, dual-source downloads, SHA-256 verification, cache busting |

\## Architecture and Workflow



\- \*\*Driver Detection \& Update\*\*  

&nbsp; - Scans HWIDs via Batch/PowerShell.  

&nbsp; - Matches against a comprehensive INF database (82,663 driver versions analyzed).  

&nbsp; - Downloads and installs verified Intel packages.



\- \*\*Usage Modes\*\*  

&nbsp; - SFX EXE (recommended for simplicity).  

&nbsp; - Batch + PowerShell orchestration.  

&nbsp; - Pure PowerShell execution.

\## Security Strengths



\- \*\*Multi-layer verification\*\*: SHA-256 hashes, digital signatures, certificate chain validation.  

\- \*\*System restore point creation\*\*: Provides rollback capability before INF installation.  

\- \*\*Dual-source downloads\*\*: Reduces risk of network failures or corrupted sources.  

\- \*\*Cache busting\*\*: Prevents stale GitHub RAW content.  

\- \*\*Signed commits\*\*: Adds trust to release integrity.  



---



\## Security Weaknesses



\- \*\*ExecutionPolicy set to Bypass\*\*: Convenient but risky; should enforce `AllSigned`.  

\- \*\*Fallback sources\*\*: Must be fully transparent and pinned to trusted domains.  

\- \*\*No sandbox/dry-run mode\*\*: INF installation is invasive; an “analyze-only” mode would reduce risk.  

\- \*\*Limited rollback beyond restore point\*\*: No automated driver export or device snapshot.  

\- \*\*Temporary directory handling\*\*: Needs stricter ACLs and unique GUID paths to prevent tampering.

\## File-Level Observations



\### `Universal-Intel-Chipset-Updater.bat`

\- \*\*Strengths\*\*: Admin enforcement, orchestration of PowerShell.  

\- \*\*Weaknesses\*\*: Needs standardized exit codes and stricter path quoting.  



\### `Universal-Intel-Chipset-Updater.ps1`

\- \*\*Strengths\*\*: Robust logging, multi-layer verification, fallback extraction methods.  

\- \*\*Weaknesses\*\*: ExecutionPolicy bypass, incomplete certificate revocation checks, lack of analyze-only mode.  



\### `Get-Intel-HWIDs.bat` / `Get-Intel-HWIDs.ps1`

\- \*\*Strengths\*\*: Effective HWID scanning.  

\- \*\*Weaknesses\*\*: Logs may expose host identifiers; recommend anonymization and standardized JSON/CSV output.

\## Documentation \& Releases



\- \*\*README\*\*: Clear usage instructions, warnings about restarts and black screens.  

\- \*\*Known Issues\*\*: Transparent reporting of limitations.  

\- \*\*Release v10.1-2025.11.5\*\*: Major security improvements (restore points, dual-source, cache busting).  

\- \*\*Release v10.1.20266.8668\*\*: Clarifies WiX licensing under Ms-RL.

\## Recommendations



1\. \*\*Script Signing \& ExecutionPolicy\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Sign scripts with trusted Code Signing certs.  

&nbsp;  - Enforce `AllSigned` policy.  



2\. \*\*Source Integrity\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Maintain allowlist of trusted hosts.  

&nbsp;  - Pin URLs and hashes.  



3\. \*\*Pre-flight \& Rollback\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Add “analyze-only” mode.  

&nbsp;  - Export drivers and snapshot devices before update.  



4\. \*\*Temporary Directory Security\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Use GUID-based paths.  

&nbsp;  - Enforce ACLs and symlink checks.  



5\. \*\*Logging \& Privacy\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Structured JSON logs.  

&nbsp;  - Mask sensitive identifiers.  



6\. \*\*Security Policy Formalization\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Define disclosure process, SLA, and threat model.

\## Final Score



\*\*8.6 / 10\*\*



\- Strong project with excellent transparency and recent security improvements.  

\- Needs script signing, stricter ExecutionPolicy, and enhanced rollback mechanisms to reach “secure by default” status.
